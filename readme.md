# Cows and Bulls Game

The concept of the game is basically that we randomly set a 4 digit number and ask the user for a 4 digit number and given him
a certain number of chances, and tell him the number of cows and bulls, where a ***cow*** represent a digit which is present in the 
randomly set number but is at the wrong place, whereas a ***bull*** is a digit which is present in the set number and is at the right place
some examples are as follows:

Suppose the set number is **4577**
then the let no. of  ***cows*** be ***c*** and ***bulls*** be  ***b***.
1) **5479 c=2 b=1**

2) **7477 c=1 b=2**

3) **7745 c=4 b=0**

4) **4976 c=0 b=2**

Similarily for other inputs , the game works as the user observes cows and bulls and proceeds to the set number in the given number
of chances.
